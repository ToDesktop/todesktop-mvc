# ToDesktop MVC

This is a companion repo to the guide on [How to Build a TodoMVC Desktop App with ToDesktop Builder](https://todesktop1.notion.site/How-to-Build-a-TodoMVC-Desktop-App-with-ToDesktop-Builder-b037fa5e34384c81af16e7d1a19333bc)

## Technologies

This project relies on the following technologies:

| Technology                                           | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) | A project that showcases the same todo application built across a range of JavaScript frameworks |
| [ToDesktop Builder](https://www.todesktop.com/) | An application for creating cross-platform desktop apps with a few lines of code   |



## Outcome

After following the [guide]((https://todesktop1.notion.site/How-to-Build-a-TodoMVC-Desktop-App-with-ToDesktop-Builder-b037fa5e34384c81af16e7d1a19333bc)), you will have a fully functional todo app that is capable of the following:

- Using keyboard shortcuts to show the app in a panel interface (like Spotlight).
- Creating todos using selected text from any application.
- Attaching logos to todos by gathering data about where the todo was created.
- Showing number of remaining todos on the application icon badge.
